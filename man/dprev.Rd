\usage{
dprev(yes = c(0), no = c(0), disp = "y", conf = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{yes}{a vector of positive pools, with the elements indicating how many
mosquitoes were in each positive pool}

\item{no}{a vector of negative pools, with the elements indicating how many
mosquitoes were in each negative pool}

\item{disp}{'y' indicates to print results to dipslay}

\item{conf}{The confidence interval to return. Default is 0.95 to yield a
95 percent confidence interval}
}
