Description: A simple, consistent interface to multiple
    disease forecasting models. It is currently configured to give estimates of
    human cases from the ArboMAP model and a Random Forest model.
    This package was developed by Alexander Keyel, Wadsworth Center, New York
    State Department of Health, Albany, NY, USA. The code development was
    supported by cooperative agreement 1U01CK000509-01, funded by the Centers
    for Disease Control and Prevention. Its contents are solely the
    responsibility of the author and do not necessarily represent the official

    Health and Human Services. See README.docx for more details. The MLE_IR.R
    file was modified with permission from Williams & Moffitt 2005. Estimation
    of pathogen prevalence in pooled samples using maximum likelihood methods
    and open source software. Journal of Aquatic Animal Health 17: 386 - 391.
