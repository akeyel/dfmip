Description: A simple, consistent interface to multiple
    disease forecasting models. It is currently configured to give estimates of
    human cases from the ArboMAP model and a Random Forest model.

    of pathogen prevalence in pooled samples using maximum likelihood methods
    and open source software. Journal of Aquatic Animal Health 17: 386 - 391.
