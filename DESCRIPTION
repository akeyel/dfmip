Description: A simple, consistent interface to multiple
    disease forecasting models. It is currently configured to give estimates of
    human cases from the ArboMAP model and a Random Forest model.
    This package was developed by Alexander Keyel, Wadsworth Center, New York
    State Department of Health, Albany, NY, USA. The code development was
    supported by cooperative agreement 1U01CK000509-01, funded by the Centers
    for Disease Control and Prevention, and by the National Socio-Environmental
    Synthesis Center (SESYNC) under funding received from the National Science
    Foundation DBI-1639145. Its contents are solely the responsibility of the

    for Disease Control and Prevention or the Department of Health and Human
    Services. See README.docx for more details. The MLE_IR.R file was modified

    prevalence in pooled samples using maximum likelihood methods and open
